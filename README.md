### Greetings traveler ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data engineer at [VITO](https://ror.org/04gq0w522) (Flemish Institute for Technological Research), where I handle all things data, coding and governance.

I contribute to European research projects, such as:
- [PARC](https://www.eu-parc.eu/): Partnership for the Assessment of Risks from Chemicals.
- [INQUIRE](https://inquire-he.eu/): Improving indoor air quality for a healthier home and Europe.
- [EIRENE](https://www.eirene-ri.eu/): Environmental Exposure Assessment Research Infrastructure.

Where I am mostly part of work related to FAIR data and data governance. 

A couple of the things I am working on:
- [PyHBM](https://rubenpeeters.github.io/portfolio/01_pyhbm/): Python package for data harmonization and FAIRification of human biomonitoring (and other) datasets.
- [HBM tools](https://rubenpeeters.github.io/portfolio/02_hbm-tools/): Public UI to expose PyHBM to researchers.
- [parco-hbm](https://github.com/eu-parc/parco-hbm): Ontology/data model related to human biomonitoring data.

And some personal projects, which you can find on my GitHub page.
